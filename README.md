# submarine
this is an attempt to build the electronic circuit for a submarine with an Arduino nano 33 IoT.
In this Project I make use of the bmp280 to meassure the temperature and air pressure,
The DHT11 to meassure the humidity and also the temperature for redundancy.
An IRF510 transistor as a switch to turn on a ventilator.
there is also a use for an MPU6050 gyroscope to indicate with some leds in wich position the submarine is floating
